# 2.3 | Dialogues | Transformation
Transform objects on dialogues

# Application
The transformation can be applied to different objects, at the moment it is: Characters and Pictures.
Accordingly, in the `object` examples it can mean both the character and the picture, and there and there it will work.

# Sized
Sometimes it happens that some character in the dialog is too big or small, for example, if mob - Silverfish or Ender Dragon :) To change this value, write:

`object.scale = 0.5f` - where the mob size is set.

# Permutation
If you want to move an object some distance, or make a small animation (more detailed picture later) type of tremor/walking from side to side, the easiest way to use:

`object.translate = Vector2f(x, y)` - donâ€™t forget to add `import net.minecraft.util.math.vector.Vector2f` at the beginning of the file,
otherwise there will be an error, x and y, it is a corresponding move on x and on y, obviously, right?
