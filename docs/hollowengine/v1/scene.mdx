# 2.1 | Dialogues | Scene

This section describes what a scene is and how to use it.

## About Scene
:::tip what is a scene?
The scene for ordinary mortals is a variable `scene` through which commands can be given.
:::

## Scene variables
- `scene add <character>` - to charm the character onstage, it will appear to the right of the previous or in the center, 
if there is no one on the scene, the character itself - a variable of the type HDCharacter, 
which was written about in [Dialogues: Start](./dialogues)
- `scene addRight <character>` - add the character to the right of the previous one.
- `scene addLeft <character>` - add the character to the left of the previous one.
- `scene focus <charcater>` - focus on the character (the character will become a little more than others, and the rest will be obscured)
- `scene remove <character>` - remove character from the scene
- `scene.clear()` - remove all characters from the scene

## Params
- `scene.autoSwitch = true/false` - enable or disable automatic character switching
  (By default, when the character starts speaking, he is added to the scene, if he is not there and there is also a focus on it, this can be disabled if necessary)
## Pictures
You can also add or remove pictures to the dialogue scene, for more information see [Dialogue Pictures](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ):
- `scene add <picture>` - Add pictures on screen, picture - it's a HDImage type variable
- `scene remove <picture>` - Removes picture from screen
