:::info New dimension stored in the folder `hollowengine/storyteller_world`
An independent dimension that you can access from any world.
> - A **special item** is required to access this dimension: Teleporter. You can get it from the `Hollow Engine` mod tab in the creative menu.
> - By simply pressing the teleporter PCM on any block you are transported to a new, empty space. You only have 1 block under you.
> - To get out of it you can simply click on any block with the same teleporter PCM, and you will find yourself where you were.
> - All changes in this dimension will be accessible from any world. (Even if you delete all worlds and create a new one).
