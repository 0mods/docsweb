# Scripts: Mods

## Description

This type of script is intended for various purposes that need to be released before the game is loaded:
- add game content : blocks, objects, entities, dimensions, etc.;
- register certain Forge or ModBus events;
- create any configs.

## Variables

### Events

`FORGE_BUS` - a variable containing the Forge event handler. Similar to the call `MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS`.
`MOD_BUS` - a variable containing the mod's event handler. Similar to the call `FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus()`.

:::info Example of processing a Forge event
```jsx
import net.minecraftforge.client.event.ScreenEvent

//When opening any interface
fun onScreenOpen(event: ScreenEvent.Opening) {
	//Here is your event handling code
}

//Passing your event to the Forge event handler
FORGE_BUS.addListener(this::onScreenOpen)

```
:::

### Other
`dist` - the side on which the code is running, a physical client or server.

:::info Usage example
```jsx
if(dist.isClient) {
	//Если скрипт запущен на клиенте
}

```
:::

## Notes
- ModBus events are tied to the HollowEngine mod, so keep this in mind when developing.
- Most likely in the near future, mod scripts will be divided into 2 parts, client and server. In this case, it will be possible not to leave the server room with clients.
