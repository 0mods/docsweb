# Scripts: Introduction

## Скриптовый KotlinScript
HollowEngine uses the advanced KotlinScript scripting engine, specially rewritten for use in mods. KotlinScript is a programming language that allows you to create scripts in Kotlin with some simplifications.
For example, you don't need to create separate classes or methods - everything you write in the script will be run as a separate method.
However, you can still adhere to all the principles of OOP, create classes, methods, inherit from other classes, etc.

If you are not familiar with the Kotlin language and programming in general,
we highly recommend that you first familiarize yourself with the [basics] (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html ),
try to understand at least such concepts as variables, methods, branches, loops, etc. Without this knowledge,
it will be very difficult for you to write even the simplest things and ready-made ** script examples for you not much help in this **.


## What scripts are there?
First of all, before you start writing scripts, you need to figure out what they are at all, here is a table with all their types

:::info Script extensions
|        Type         |  Extension  |                                         Description                                          |     Comment      |
|:-------------------:|:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------:|
|         Mod         |   mod.kts   |  It starts when the game starts. Allows you to do the same thing that can be done in mods.   |     Released     |
|     Story Event     |   se.kts    | It is started by the command. Allows you to create all sorts of triggers, events, NPCs, etc. |     Released     |
|      Dialogues      |   hsd.kts   |                  It is started by the command. Allows you to make dialogs.                   |     Disabled     |

| Spongepowered Mixin |  mixin.kts  |                  Allows you to change the game code directly in the script.                  | In Developerment |

## How to create a script?

First of all, install the mod and enter the world.
After that, the hollowengine folder will appear in the folder with the game (by default: .minecraft).
In it, you can create scripts.
I recommend distributing files into different folders,
for example: `hollowengine/scripts/modpack/chapter_1/prologue/....`

File names must have the form `name.type.kts`, where name is the name of the script, type is the type of script (see the table above), `.kts` is the end of the script, and it should be called that.

After the launch, there will be a compilation; it can take from 5 seconds to 3-5 minutes,
depending on the size of the script and the performance of the PC. After the first compilation, the script is packaged in a jar and run instantly.
(In the future, it will be possible to run them as separate mini-mods) When you change the script and run it again, the script is compiled again.
