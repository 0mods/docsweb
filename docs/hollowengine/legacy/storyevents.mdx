# 3.0 | Story Event | Basics

## Story Event file
Before moving on to the story, I advise you to familiarize yourself with the [script engine](./introducing).

About file extensions you can be found [here](./storyfiles)

## Start story event
:::tip about a start
To start a storyline event, type `/hollowengine start-script`, after the next argument tells whether `ignoring the completed events` (true/false),
if the event has already been completed, it will not start without a `true` argument and then the next argument finds your event in the list.
If you specify a player name or a type `@a` tag after the name, the dialog will start with a specific player/group.
