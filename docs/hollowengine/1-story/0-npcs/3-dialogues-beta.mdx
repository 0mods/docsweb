```kts title="Example of Dialog"
dialogue {
        <npcID> say "Hallo!"

        choices {
            "<Choice 1>" {
                // P.s. <After..>
            }

            "<Choice 2>" {
                // P.s. <After..>
            }

:::info Its just an example!
In the template, instead of "Choice" you can put "your ðŸ’€ are too ðŸ’€ to be ðŸ’€"

```kts title="Example"
dialogue {
        npc say "Hallo!"

        choices {
            "Ok, hello!" {
                npc say "You who?"
            }

            "Bye-bye" {
                npc say "NO!"
            }
