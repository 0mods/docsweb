# Introduction

HollowEngine is a multifunctional engine that allows you to create a variety of stories in the game. But this is not its only function. It provides many opportunities for modding, not limited to just creating NPCs.

At the moment, HollowEngine provides a simple and convenient way to create scripts in Kotlin. In the future, there will be other features, such as visual editors and commands.

If you have any questions about fashion, you can contact us at [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qKpPhkwGCY).

# Where to start?
