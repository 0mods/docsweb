# Tutorial №3 | Dialogue system

:::note Let's create a simple dialog in a special window and consequences

```kts
val npc by NPCEntity.creating {
    name = "NPC"
    world = "minecraft:overworld"
    pos = pos(0, -58, 0)
}

dialogue{
    npc say { "Hi" \}
	choiсe {
		"Hi!" {
			team.sendAsPlayer { "It's been a while!" }
			npc say { "What's up?" }
			choise {
				"Everything's great." {
					npc say{ "I'm glad to hear it :)" }
				}
				"Убейте меня." {
					npc say { "Well, he asked for it." }
					wait { 1.sec }
					npc say { "Then don't whine!" }
				}
			}
		}
		"Эм.." {
			npc playLooped{ "face-what" }
			npc say { "Something wrong?" }
			choise {
				"Huh? No." {
					team.sendAsPlayer { "No, I'm fine. I just have a headache" }
				}
				"Who the hell are you?" {
					npc say { "I'm totally freaking out." }
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
