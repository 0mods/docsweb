> We spawn a basic NPC named "NPC", wait 2 sec, tell him to go to some point (position), then looks in the direction of the player, passes 3 sec and disappears.

```kts
val npc by NPCEntity.creating{
    name = "NPC"
    world = "minecraft:overworld"
    pos = pos(0, -58, 0)
}
wait { 2.sec }

npc moveToPos { pos(-10, -58, 6) }
npc lookAtTeam { team }
wait { 3.sec }
