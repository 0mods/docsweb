# The visibility of Items

:::info To display items in the hands of the NPC, it's sufficient to simply create two groups with the specified names :
> - `LeftHandItem` - For the left hand.
> - `RightHandItem` - For the right hand.
Place it where you need it. You can move it around.
You can also animate it with animations, and it will work.
