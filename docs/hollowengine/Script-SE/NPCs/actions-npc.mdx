## Actions with items

### Drop an item

:::info Specify the item, that NPC should drop
```kts
<npcID> dropItem { item("<itemID>") } // For now it works roughly, Send only in South. Waiting for a patch.
```
It is very simple to specify the item. Just take the necessary item in your main hand and then type the command `/hollowengine hand`, it will copy the item data along with `item`. You just need to paste it, and that's it.
:::

### Hold the item in the hand

:::caution
`item("<itemID>")` can be obtained through: `/hollowengine hand`; Just take the desired item in your hand and use this command, it will be copied, and you can paste it wherever needed.
:::

#### Method №1

:::info Just drom him the item. He'll pick up it in his right hand.
```kts
// Nothing is needed.
```
