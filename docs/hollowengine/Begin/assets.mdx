# Assets
What are these magic folders?
:::info assets
> Create a new folder in `hollowengine` named `assets`, and within that folder, create another folder named `hollowengine`.
> ```sheme
> hollowengine
> \- assets
>    \- <modID>
> ```

In this folder, you can place resources, similar to resource packs.

---

## Models Resources

> You can store resources wherever you prefer, but for beginners, it's recommended to store them in these locations:
> `<modID>/models/entity/*` - Models,
> `<modID>/textures/entity` - Textures for models.

---

## Sounds Resources

> Store sounds strictly in `hollowengine/sounds/*`.

---

## Other Resources

> You can store all other resources as you like. However, once again, it's recommended for those unfamiliar with how everything works to store resources in a manner similar to the game and resource packs.
