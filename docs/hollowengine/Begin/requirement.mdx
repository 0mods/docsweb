# Mod Dependencies

What I need?

:::caution The mod `Hollow Engine` requires the following mods to function:
```mermaid 
graph TD
   A[HollowEngine]-->|Required| B[HollowCore];
   A-->|Optional| C[FTBTeams];
   C-->|Required| E[FTBLibrary];
   E-->|Required| F[Architectury];
   B-->|Required| G[KotlinForForge];
```
ℹ️ FTBTeams is optional library! Install, if you want to make a story ℹ️

ℹ️Photon is optional library! Install, if you want to make special effects for NPC (Required FTBTeams for creating NPCs) ℹ️

⚠️ HollowCore needs classic version, without marker(i.e. **no-compiler**, **lite**, **original**) ⚠️
