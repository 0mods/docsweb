# Resources (or `Assets`)

Just put file in folder `assets` - is stupid mistake

<link rel="preload" as="image" href="@site/static/img/doc/titles/Assets0.webp" />
<div className="show" id="mask">

![resources](@site/static/img/doc/titles/Assets0.webp)

</div>
</div>

Folder `assets` work like resoucepacks, but without necessity create archives for your resources.

## Resource Location

Resource Location in Minecraft is often used as an identifier for items, as well as to indicate the location of resource files such as models and textures.

### Structures

Resource Location consists of two strings: namespace and path. Namespace is usually mod id. Path can be a name (for items) or a file path (for resources).

Также, Resource Location можно записать как: `namespace:path`.

### Character case

You should not use capital letters or special characters in the Resource Location. This can cause problems when working with resources, especially on different operating systems.

It is recommended that the Resource Location only contain lowercase letters (English alphabet), numbers, underscores (`_`) and hyphens (`-`).

### Преобразование в путь к файлу
When a Resource Location points to a mod resource or file, it refers to a specific location in the file system. All resources are loaded the same way.

It is recommended to use the `assets` and `data` folders that are automatically created in the `hollowengine` folder to load your resources, but you can use other methods to load resources, including third-party mods and resource packs.
<br />
The `assets` folder is used for client-side resources, including models, textures, translation files, audio, etc.
<br />
The `data` folder is used for server-side resources, including recipes, structures, achievements, etc.

The full path is formed as follows:
- Place your resources at the root path (`.minecraft/hollowengine/assets/` or `.minecraft/hollowengine/data/`).
- Create a namespace. (mod id)
- Specify the remaining path to your resource.
<br />
For example: `.minecraft/hollowengine/assets/mod_id/models/npcs/example.gltf`.
<br />
Here we have the root path: `.minecraft/hollowengine/assets/`.
<br />
Namespace: `mod_id`.
<br />
The remaining path is `models/npcs/example.gltf`.

And in the script, the path is already specified in the format `namespace:path`, in this case: `mod_id:models/npcs/example.gltf`.

### Models

:::note Models
<div align="left">
> List supported formates:
> - `glTF [.gltf]`
> - `GLB [.glb]`

All models are specified in **your namespace** in the `models` folder. You can create child folders in there if needed.

Hint: If you need information about a model, try the command `/hollowengine model <resource location>`

### Textures

:::note Textures
<div align="left">
> List of supported textures:
<br />
> Static:
> - `PNF [.png]`
> - `Jpeg [.jpg, jpeg]`
<br />
> Animated:
> - `GIF [.gif]`
> - `APNG [.png]` - рекомендуется использовать его, у него лучше цветопередача. 

All textures are specified in **your namespace** in the `textures` folder. You can create child folders in there if needed.
</div>

### Audio, sounds, music

:::note Sounds
<div align="left">
> List of supported sounds:
> - `Vorbis [.ogg]`
> - `Waveform Audio File [.wav]`
> - `MP3 [.mp3]`

All sounds are specified in **your namespace** in the `audio` folder. You can create child folders in it if necessary.
Note: The default `sounds` folder is **not used** to avoid conflicts with other mods and their sounds, HollowCore uses its own loading method to support different formats.
</div>

:::warning Warning
The game will not automatically reload your resources when changing them. After **any** change to resources, you must reload the resources.
You can do this with the `F3 + T` keyboard shortcut or in the code editor in the `File` tab.
