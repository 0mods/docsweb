# Getting Started

:::info
To start working on your plot, go to the `scripts` section (folder) and create a file: `<name>.<scriptType>.kts`.
> Designations:
> - `<name>` - any file name.
> - `<scriptType>` - [Script Types](./scripts-type)
:::

:::caution If your script takes a long time to start...
> It's normal. It is compiled from the script into a `jar`, and after compilation, it runs the script from the `jar`.
