# Mod Dependencies

What I need?

:::caution The mod `Hollow Engine` requires the following mods to function:
```mermaid 
graph TD;
   HollowEngine-->[Required] HollowCore;
   HollowEngine-->[Optional] FTBTeams;
   HollowEngine-->[Optional, if FTBTeams installed] Photon;
   FTBTeams-->[Required] FTBLibrary;
   FTBLibrary-->[Required] Architectury;
   HollowCore-->[Required] KotlinForForge;
```
ℹ️ FTBTeams is optional library! Install, if you want to make a story ℹ️

ℹ️Photon is optional library! Install, if you want to make special effects for NPC (Required FTBTeams for creating NPCs) ℹ️

⚠️ HollowCore needs classic version, without marker(i.e **no-compiler**, **lite**, **original**) ⚠️
