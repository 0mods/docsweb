# Mod Dependencies

What I need?

:::caution The mod `Hollow Engine` requires the following mods to function:
```mermaid 
graph TD;
   HollowEngine-->HollowCore;
   HollowEngine-->FTBTeams;
   FTBTeams-->FTBLibrary;
   FTBTeams-->Architectury;
   FTBLibrary-->Architectury;
   HollowCore-->KotlinForForge;
```
ℹ️ FTBTeams is Optional library! Install, if you want to make a story ℹ️

⚠️ HollowCore needs classic version, without marker(i.e **no-compiler**, **lite**, **original**) ⚠️
