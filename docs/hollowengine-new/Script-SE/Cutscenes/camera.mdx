# Camera

## Create a Camera

:::info Add a camera
```jsx
createCameraPath{
    // Everything below this
}

```
:::

## Settings of the Camera

:::info The camera has parameters such as
```jsx
    spline(<time>,
        vec(<pitch_start>, <yaw_start>), vec(<pitch_end>, <yaw_end>) // Camera rotation from Start to End of the path
        pos(x, y, z), // double. If there are more positions after this, put "," at the end of this line
        interpolation = Interpolation.<interpolationType> // How you want to smooth camera movement. If you don't specify interpolation, LINEAR will be applied by default
        // And so on for as many camera position points as you need
    )
    // If necessary, you can create another path
```
> Designations:
> - `time` - Sets the total time for camera movement.
>   - `<num>` - Time in ticks.
>   - `<num>.sec` - Time in seconds.
>   - `<num>.min`, - Time in minutes.
>   - `<num>.hour`, - Time in hours.
>   - You can also combine them, using `+`, for example: `1.hour + 15.min + 30.sec + 45`.
> - `interpolation = <interpolations>` - Sets the interpolation of movement. (In simpler terms, it speeds up or slows down at certain moments depending on the chosen interpolation).
>  - `interpolationType` - [List of interpolations](../Tools/interpolations)
> - `vec(<pitch_start>, <yaw_start>), vec(<pitch_end>, <yaw_end>)` - Sets the camera rotation at the start (`_start`) and at the end (`_end`).
> - `pos(x, y, z)`  - Sets the position point. Works only with non-integer numbers.
