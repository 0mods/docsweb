# Tutorial â„–2

:::note Let's create a path for camera movement consisting of 3 points. The path duration will be 10 seconds, and we'll set the interpolation to `SINE_IN_OUT`.
```jsx
createCameraPath {
    spline(10.sec,
        vec(-180f, 0f), vec(-150f, -10f),
        pos(120.34, 64, -12.53),
        pos(130.43, 65, -23.65),
        pos(100.23, 67, -34.32),
        interpolation = Interpolation.SINE_IN_OUT
    )
}
```
