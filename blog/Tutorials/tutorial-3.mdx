# Tutorial â„–3

:::note "Let's create a simple dialogue in a special window along with its consequences."

```kotlin
dialogue{
	npc say{"Hi!"}
	choise{
		"Hello!!"{
			team.sendAsPlayer{"It's been a long time!"}
			npc say{"What's up?"}
			choise{
				"Everything's super!"{
					npc say{"Glad to hear that.)"}
				}
				"Kill me."{
					npc say{"You asked for it."}
					wait{1.sec}
					npc say{"Don't cry later!"}
				}
			}
		}
		"Umm.." {
			npc playLooped{"face-what"}
			npc say{"Did something happen?"}
			choise{
				"What? Oh nothing.."{
					team.sendAsPlayer{"Everything's okay. I'm just ill."}
				}
				"Who are you?"{
					npc say{"i'm in a total shock."}
